# fakenews_detect
The project aims to develop a data science solution to predict fake news using predictive analytics techniques.

This project focuses on developing a data science solution for detecting fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to build a model that can classify news articles into two categories: fake or genuine. By automating the detection process, we aim to assist users in making informed decisions and promote reliable information dissemination.

Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
